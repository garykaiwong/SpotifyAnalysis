<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
ETL:
Extracted from our data sources to build a base for each visualization we worked on. Filtered data to contain only tracks with a popularity of >2 and still 520K rows.  
Obtained the ten most popular songs from each year and loaded them into a mongoDB. We used our Javascript development skills to upload our datasets. We used this to showcase each visualization on our webpage!

## Who can use this data

This project can be used to find out which songs were streamed the most and by which artists in the given year. It can also be used to see how each member of a BoyBand is predicted to do on their own. Finally, It will show which attributes make the most streamed songs stream-able (e.g. explicit language, danceability,etc)

## Prerequisites:
* Visualization must include a Python Flaskâ€“powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
* Project should fall into one of the below three tracks: 
* A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
* A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
* A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to an approved visualization.
* Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
* Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
* Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
* Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
